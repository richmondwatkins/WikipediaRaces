==============

The user is given two words (for example, Bilbo Baggins and Martin Luther King Jr.) and is taken to the wiki page of the first word. Without leaving Wikipedia, they have to click on links (starting from the first word's wiki page) until they get to the second word. For example,

Bilbo Baggins > Lord of the Rings > JR Tolkein > England > United States > US Civil Rights Movement > Martin Luther King Jr
